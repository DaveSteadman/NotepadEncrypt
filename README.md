# NotepadEncrypt
A simple notepad application that can load and save files using the .net encryption functionality.

## Legal Disclaimer
This application is available in code only format, for a user to read, understand and build for their own purposes. It comes with no warranty or statement about being fit for purpose. If you encrypt a file and cannot re-enter the password, the data is effectively lost.

## Content
See EncryptOperations.cs for the "real" operation, and MainWindow.xaml.cs for code that calls it.
The code is 5 minutes of ChatGPT noodling, and is filed under the most-permissive license.

## Why
A protected file that you understand is a decent place for password storage. Keep backups of any file in case you typo the password.
